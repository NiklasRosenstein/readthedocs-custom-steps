- type: improvement
  component: general
  description: Read `.readthedocs-custom-steps.yml`, fall back to `.readthedocs.yml`
    and `x-custom-steps` only if the former file does not exist. Read the Docs does
    not currently support custom keys in the configuration, which is why we need a
    separate file.
  fixes: []
